# Deep Inertial Poser: Learning to Reconstruct Human Pose from Sparse Inertial Measurements in Real Time
## Code
This repository contains the code published alongside with our SIGGRAPH Asia [paper](http://dip.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/assets/dip.pdf). It is organised as follows: [`train_and_eval`](train_and_eval) contains code to train and evaluate the neural networks proposed in the paper. [`live_demo`](live_demo) contains Unity and Python scripts to use the models for real-time inference. Please refer to the READMEs in the respective subfolder for more details.

## Data
To download the data please visit the [project page](http://dip.is.tuebingen.mpg.de). Please note that the data is still in preparation but will be made public asap.
